# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project

## Overview
This project utilizes various machine learning techniques to predict demand in bike-sharing systems based on environmental and seasonal variables. The analysis is performed using R, and the dataset includes hourly rental data alongside weather and seasonal information.

## Data
The dataset includes features such as season, working day, weather situation, temperature, humidity, and windspeed, and the target variable is the count of total bike rentals (`cnt`).

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset file `hour.csv`.
- `R Markdown files`: Includes all the scripts and their outputs for the analysis.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Loading**: Data is loaded from the `hour.csv` file.
- **Variable Selection**: Irrelevant variables such as `instant` and `dteday` are removed for the analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: The `cnt` variable is transformed using a logarithmic scale to normalize its distribution.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Correlation Analysis**: Correlations between different variables are visualized using heatmaps to identify potential predictors.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is conducted to reduce dimensionality and identify the most influential features.

### Model Development
1. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Models are built using the selected features to predict bike sharing demand.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.
3. **Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection**: Used to optimize the selection of predictor variables in the regression model.
4. **Lasso Regression**: Implemented to enhance model prediction by penalizing less important features.

### Validation
- **Splitting Data**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
- **Cross-validation**: Used to ensure the model's robustness and generalization across different subsets of the data.

## Key Findings
- **Model Performance**: The final model shows an adequate fit with a reasonable balance between bias and variance, indicating effective learning from the data.
- **Variable Importance**: Temperature, hour of the day, and humidity were found to be significant predictors of bike rental demand.

## Usage
- **Execution**: Run the R Markdown files in RStudio to reproduce the analysis and visualize the findings.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that all required libraries (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `glmnet`, `caret`, etc.) are installed.

## Conclusions
The analysis provides insights into the factors affecting bike-sharing demand and demonstrates the efficacy of regression techniques in predicting it. Future work could explore more complex models or incorporate additional data sources such as real-time user feedback.
